       1You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
       1Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
       1down a gully.
       2You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.  The road slopes back
       2down the other side of the hill.  There is a building in the distance.
       3You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.
       4You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a
       4rocky bed.
       5You are in open forest, with a deep valley to one side.
       6You are in open forest near both a valley and a road.
       7At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit
       7in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.
       8You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set into the
       8dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.  A dry streambed
       8leads into the depression.
       9You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the surface.
       9A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the west.
      10You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There is a dim light
      10at the east end of the passage.
      11You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
      11A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris
      11here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  A note on the wall
      11says "magic word xyzzy".
      12You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.
      13You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls are frozen
      13rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a good passage exit
      13from east and west sides of the chamber.
      14At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.  An east
      14passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.
      15You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to
      15the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone
      15staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist
      15swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the
      15staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.
      16The crack is far too small for you to follow.
      17You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.
      17The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.
      18This is a low room with a crude note on the wall.  The note says,
      18"you won't get it up the steps".
      19You are in the hall of the mountain king, with passages off in all
      19directions.
      20You are at the bottom of the pit with a broken neck.
      21You didn't make it.
      22The dome is unclimbable.
      23You are at the west end of the twopit room.  There is a large hole in
      23the wall above the pit at this end of the room.
      24You are at the bottom of the eastern pit in the twopit room.  There is
      24a small pool of oil in one corner of the pit.
      25You are at the bottom of the western pit in the twopit room.  There is
      25a large hole in the wall about 25 feet above you.
      26You clamber up the plant and scurry through the hole at the top.
      27You are on the west side of the fissure in the hall of mists.
      28You are in a low n/s passage at a hole in the floor.  The hole goes
      28down to an e/w passage.
      29You are in the south side chamber.
      30You are in the west side chamber of the hall of the mountain king.
      30A passage continues west and up here.
      31>$<
      32You can't get by the snake.
      33You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the
      33west, and a wall of broken rock to the east.  There is a large "y2" on
      33a rock in the room's center.
      34You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks everywhere.
      35You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
      35sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
      35white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right.
      35Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
      35someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
      3525 Feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
      35Shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
      36You are in a dirty broken passage.  To the east is a crawl.  To the
      36west is a large passage.  Above you is a hole to another passage.
      37You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.  A crawl leads
      37west.
      38You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little stream, which
      38enters and exits through tiny slits.
      39You are in a large room full of dusty rocks.  There is a big hole in
      39the floor.  There are cracks everywhere, and a passage leading east.
      40You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
      40of the hall of mists.
      41You are at the west end of hall of mists.  A low wide crawl continues
      41west and another goes north.  To the south is a little passage 6 feet
      41off the floor.
      42You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

      57You are on the brink of a thirty foot pit with a massive orange column
      57down one wall.  You could climb down here but you could not get back
      57up.  The maze continues at this level.
      58Dead end
      59You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
      59of the hall of mists.
      60You are at the east end of a very long hall apparently without side
      60chambers.  To the east a low wide crawl slants up.  To the north a
      60round two foot hole slants down.
      61You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.  The hall
      61joins up with a narrow north/south passage.
      62You are at a crossover of a high n/s passage and a low e/w one.
      63Dead end
      64You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees passage from the
      64north joins a higher crawl from the east to make a walking passage
      64going west.  There is also a large room above.  The air is damp here.
      65You are in bedquilt, a long east/west passage with holes everywhere.
      65To explore at random select north, south, up, or down.
      66You are in a room whose walls resemble swiss cheese.  Obvious passages
      66go west, east, ne, and nw.  Part of the room is occupied by a large
      66bedrock block.
      67You are at the east end of the twopit room.  The floor here is
      67littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy to descend the pits.
      67There is a path here bypassing the pits to connect passages from east
      67and west.  There are holes all over, but the only big one is on the
      67wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.
      68You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab
      68fallen from the ceiling (slab room).  East and west there once were
      68large passages, but they are now filled with boulders.  Low small
      68passages go north and south, and the south one quickly bends west
      68around the boulders.
      69You are in a secret n/s canyon above a large room.
      70You are in a secret n/s canyon above a sizable passage.
      71You are in a secret canyon at a junction of three canyons, bearing
      71north, south, and se.  The north one is as tall as the other two
      71combined.
      72You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, se, and sw.
      73Dead end crawl.
      74You are in a secret canyon which here runs e/w.  It crosses over a
      74very tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down you may not be able
      74to get back up.
      75You are at a wide place in a very tight n/s canyon.
      76The canyon here becomes too tight to go further south.
      77You are in a tall e/w canyon.  A low tight crawl goes 3 feet north and
      77seems to open up.
      78The canyon runs into a mass of boulders -- dead end.
      79The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer pipes.
      79It would be advisable to use the exit.

      87You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
      88You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight to the
      88west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which you can see a
      88profusion of leaves.
      89There is nothing here to climb.  Use "up" or "out" to leave the pit.
      90You have climbed up the plant and out of the pit.
      91You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.  You could
      91climb down here, but you would not be able to climb up.  There is a
      91passage leading back to the north.
      92You are in the giant room.  The ceiling here is too high up for your
      92lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east, north, and south.  On
      92the west wall is scrawled the inscription, "fee fie foe foo" [sic].
      93The passage here is blocked by a recent cave-in.
      94You are at one end of an immense north/south passage.
      95You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream, which cascades
      95over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring whirlpool which disappears
      95through a hole in the floor.  Passages exit to the south and west.
      96You are in the soft room.  The walls are covered with heavy curtains,
      96the floor with a thick pile carpet.  Moss covers the ceiling.
      97This is the oriental room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings cover the
      97walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another
      97passage leads se, and a hands and knees crawl leads west.
      98You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern.
      98Far below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be
      98heard.  The mist rises up through a fissure in the ceiling.  The path
      98exits to the south and west.
      99You are in an alcove.  A small nw path seems to widen after a short
      99distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leads east.  It looks like a very
      99tight squeeze.  An eerie light can be seen at the other end.
     100You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light.  An extremely
     100narrow tunnel exits to the west.  A dark corridor leads ne.
     101You're in the dark-room.  A corridor leading south is the only exit.
     102You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage once continued up and east
     102from here, but is now blocked by debris.  The air smells of sea water.
     103You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.  The floor and
     103walls are littered with bits of shells imbedded in the stone.  A
     103shallow passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads
     103up.  A low hands and knees passage enters from the south.
     104You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.
     105You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.
     106You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the east.  Small
     106passages go west and up.  The remnants of recent digging are evident.
     106A sign in midair here says "cave under construction beyond this point.
     106Proceed at own risk.  [Witt construction company]"
     107You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.
     108You are at witt's end.  Passages lead off in *all* directions.
     109You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is
     109covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
     109upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
     109above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
     109midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
     109for the use of the dwarves, who as you know, are extremely vain.)  A
     109small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.
     110You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
     110sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
     110white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the left.
     110Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
     110someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
     11025 Feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
     110Shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
     111A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reaches the floor
     111below.  You could climb down it, and jump from it to the floor, but
     111having done so you would be unable to reach it to climb back up.
     112You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.
     113You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud
     113of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is
     113fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet
     113overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
     113mist.  The only passage goes back toward the south.
     114Dead end
     115You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the
     115giant room.  It appears to be a repository for the "adventure"
     115program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky
     115yellow light.  Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all
     115of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed
     115of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and
     115a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves
     115are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign nearby reads: "do
     115not disturb the dwarves!"  an immense mirror is hanging against one
     115wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other
     115sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.
     116You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one side is a pit
     116full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side is a row of small
     116wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird.  In one
     116corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends.  A
     116large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.  A
     116vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At your feet is a large
     116steel grate, next to which is a sign which reads, "treasure vault.
     116Keys in main office."
     117You are on one side of a large, deep chasm.  A heavy white mist rising
     117up from below obscures all view of the far side.  A sw path leads away
     117from the chasm into a winding corridor.
     118You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight in both
     118directions.
     119You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
     120You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
     121You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
     122You are on the far side of the chasm.  A ne path leads away from the
     122chasm on this side.
     123You're in a long east/west corridor.  A faint rumbling noise can be
     123heard in the distance.
     124The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull rumbling
     124seems to get louder in that direction.  The right fork leads southeast
     124down a gentle slope.  The main corridor enters from the west.
     125The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard a steady
     125roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling.  Another
     125passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.
     126You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an
     126active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
     126out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the
     126farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
     126thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
     126sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to
     126the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
     126sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
     126formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
     126light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
     126gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
     126have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
     126crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
     126gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To
     126the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
     126from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
     126ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
     126own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already
     126hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.
     127You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders.  The walls are
     127very warm, causing the air in the room to be almost stifling from the
     127heat.  The only exit is a crawl heading west, through which is coming
     127a low rumbling.
     128You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passage lined with
     128oddly shaped limestone formations.
     129You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren room.  A sign
     129posted above the entrance reads:  "caution!  bear in room!"
     130You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room is completely
     130empty except for some dust.  Marks in the dust lead away toward the
     130far end of the room.  The only exit is the way you came in.
     131You are in a maze of twisting little passages, all different.

       1Somewhere nearby is colossal cave, where others have found fortunes in
       1treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
       1seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes
       1and hands.  Direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words.  I should warn
       1you that i look at only the first five letters of each word, so you'll
       1have to enter "northeast" as "ne" to distinguish it from "north".
       1(Should you get stuck, type "help" for some general hints.  For infor-
       1mation on how to end your adventure, etc., type "info".)

       2A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.
       3A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little
       3axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.
       4There is a threatening little dwarf in the room with you!
       5One sharp nasty knife is thrown at you!
       6None of them hit you!
       7One of them gets you!
       8A hollow voice says "plugh".
       9There is no way to go that direction.
      10I am unsure how you are facing.  Use compass points or nearby objects.
      11I don't know in from out here.  Use compass points or name something
      11in the general direction you want to go.
      12I don't know how to apply that word here.
      13I don't understand that!
      14I'm game.  Would you care to explain how?
      15Sorry, but i am not allowed to give more detail.  I will repeat the
      15long description of your location.
      16It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.
      17If you prefer, simply type w rather than west.
      18Are you trying to catch the bird?
      19The bird is frightened right now and you cannot catch it no matter
      19what you try.  Perhaps you might try later.
      20Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?
      21You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it, or anything
      21like that.  There is a way to get by, but you don't have the necessary
      21resources right now.
      22Do you really want to quit now?
      23You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!
      24You are already carrying it!
      25You can't be serious!
      26The bird was unafraid when you entered, but as you approach it becomes
      26disturbed and you cannot catch it.
      27You can catch the bird, but you cannot carry it.
      28There is nothing here with a lock!
      29You aren't carrying it!
      30The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an astounding flurry
      30drives the snake away.
      31You have no keys!
      32It has no lock.
      33I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.
      34It was already locked.
      35The grate is now locked.
      36The grate is now unlocked.
      37It was already unlocked.
      38You have no source of light.
      39Your lamp is now on.
      40Your lamp is now off.
      41There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain, which is
      41probably just as well.
      42Nothing happens.
      43Where?
      44There is nothing here to attack.
      45The little bird is now dead.  Its body disappears.
      46Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
      47You killed a little dwarf.
      48You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
      49With what?  your bare hands?
      50Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.
      51I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary
      51describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words
      51like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,
      51up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod
      51hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of
      51the action words that i know.  Usually you will need to give both the
      51object and action words (in either order), but sometimes i can infer
      51the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in
      51particular, "inventory" implies "take inventory", which causes me to
      51give you a list of what you're carrying.  The objects have side
      51effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having
      51trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people
      51trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something
      51beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely
      51different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long
      51distances with a single word.  For example, "building" usually gets
      51you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the
      51forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a
      51room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.
      51Good luck!
      52It misses!
      53It gets you!
      54Ok
      55You can't unlock the keys.
      56You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up back in the
      56main passage.
      57I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can run on
      57the surface for long.  I would try the stream.
      58I need more detailed instructions to do that.
      59I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate
      59things.  I cannot tell you where remote things are.
      60I don't know that word.
      61What?
      62Are you trying to get into the cave?
      63The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You cannot
      63enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I would recommend
      63looking elsewhere for the keys.
      64The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
      64occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of under-
      64growth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of
      64various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by
      64all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the
      64spruce and berry bushes.
      65Welcome to adventure!!  would you like instructions?
      66Ddigging without a shovel is quite impractical.  Even with a shovel
      66progress is unlikely.
      67Blasting requires dynamite.
      68I'm as confused as you are.
      69Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time in
      69caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign of a deep
      69pit leading down to water.
      70Your feet are now wet.
      71I think i just lost my appetite.
      72Thank you, it was delicious!
      73You have taken a drink from the stream.  The water tastes strongly of
      73minerals, but is not unpleasant.  It is extremely cold.
      74The bottle of water is now empty.
      75Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.  Anyway,
      75nothing exciting happens.
      76Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.
      77Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.
      78You can't pour that.
      79Watch it!
      80Which way?
      81Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able to
      81help you out, but i've never really done this before.  Do you want me
      81to try to reincarnate you?
      82All right.  But don't blame me if something goes wr......
      82        --- Poof!! ---
      82you are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke.  Coughing and gasping,
      82you emerge from the smoke and find....
      83You clumsy oaf, you've done it again!  i don't know how long i can
      83keep this up.  Do you want me to try reincarnating you again?
      84Okay, now where did i put my orange smoke?....  >Poof!<
      84everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.
      85Now you've really done it!  i'm out of orange smoke!  you don't expect
      85me to do a decent reincarnation without any orange smoke, do you?
      86Okay, if you're so smart, do it yourself!  i'm leaving!
      90>>> Messages 81 thru 90 are reserved for "obituaries". <<<
      91Sorry, but i no longer seem to remember how it was you got here.
      92You can't carry anything more.  You'll have to drop something first.
      93You can't go through a locked steel grate!
      94I believe what you want is right here with you.
      95You don't fit through a two-inch slit!
      96I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge instead of jumping.
      97There is no way across the fissure.
      98You're not carrying anything.
      99You are currently holding the following:
     100It's not hungry (it's merely pinin' for the fjords).  Besides, you
     100have no bird seed.
     101The snake has now devoured your bird.
     102There's nothing here it wants to eat (except perhaps you).
     103You fool, dwarves eat only coal!  now you've made him *really* mad!!
     104You have nothing in which to carry it.
     105Your bottle is already full.
     106There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.
     107Your bottle is now full of water.
     108Your bottle is now full of oil.
     109You can't fill that.
     110Don't be ridiculous!
     111The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.
     112The plant indignantly shakes the oil off its leaves and asks, "water?"
     113The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.
     114The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now move,
     114although it requires some effort.
     115The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.
     116The dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.
     117Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you.
     117You'd best take inventory and drop something.
     118You can't fit this five-foot clam through that little passage!
     119You can't fit this five-foot oyster through that little passage!
     120I advise you to put down the clam before opening it.  >Strain!<
     121I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.  >Wrench!<
     122You don't have anything strong enough to open the clam.
     123You don't have anything strong enough to open the oyster.
     124A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.  Goodness,
     124this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very good at identifying
     124bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.
     125The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.  It
     125promptly snaps shut again.
     126You have crawled around in some little holes and found your way
     126blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in the main passage.
     127There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.
     128Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!  "har, har,"
     128he chortles, "i'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me
     128chest deep in the maze!"  he snatches your treasure and vanishes into
     128the gloom.
     129A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave, says, "cave closing
     129soon.  All adventurers exit immediately through main office."
     130A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:
     130   "this exit is closed.  Please leave via main office."
     131It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so close to
     131closing time anyway, i think we'll just call it a day.
     132The sepulchral voice entones, "the cave is now closed."  As the echoes
     132fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
     132smoke). . . .   As your eyes refocus, you look around and find...
     133There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
     133wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole
     133and find yourself in the main office, where a cheering band of
     133friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.
     134There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
     134wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river of molten lava pours
     134in through the hole, destroying everything in its path, including you!
     135There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed across the
     135walls of the room.
     136The resulting ruckus has awakened the dwarves.  There are now several
     136threatening little dwarves in the room with you!  most of them throw
     136knives at you!  all of them get you!
     137Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.
     138I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere.
     139I don't know the word "stop".  Use "quit" if you want to give up.
     140You can't get there from here.
     141You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.
     142If you want to end your adventure early, say "quit".  To suspend your
     142adventure such that you can continue later, say "suspend" (or "pause"
     142or "save").  To see what hours the cave is normally open, say "hours".
     142To see how well you're doing, say "score".  To get full credit for a
     142treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though you get
     142partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points for getting
     142killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.  There are
     142also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to
     142explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to
     142distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), and there are
     142other ways to determine whether you've been through some of the more
     142harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, just
     142keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you
     142haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting *does* happen,
     142it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many
     142more points in the master's section.  I may occasionally offer hints
     142if you seem to be having trouble.  If i do, i'll warn you in advance
     142how much it will affect your score to accept the hints.  Finally, to
     142save paper, you may specify "brief", which tells me never to repeat
     142the full description of a place unless you explicitly ask me to.
     143Do you indeed wish to quit now?
     144There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.
     145The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered the vase.
     146It is beyond your power to do that.
     147I don't know how.
     148It is too far up for you to reach.
     149You killed a little dwarf.  The body vanishes in a cloud of greasy
     149black smoke.
     150The shell is very strong and is impervious to attack.
     151What's the matter, can't you read?  now you'd best start over.
     152The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales.
     153The dragon looks rather nasty.  You'd best not try to get by.
     154The little bird attacks the green dragon, and in an astounding flurry
     154gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow away.
     155On what?
     156Okay, from now on i'll only describe a place in full the first time
     156you come to it.  To get the full description, say "look".
     157Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as tough as
     157that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your blows effortlessly.
     158The troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully, and tosses it
     158back, declaring, "good workmanship, but it's not valuable enough."
     159The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.
     160The troll refuses to let you cross.
     161There is no longer any way across the chasm.
     162Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath the
     162weight of the bear, which was still following you around.  You
     162scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridge collapses you
     162stumble back and fall into the chasm.
     163The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startled shriek and
     163scurries away.  The bear soon gives up the pursuit and wanders back.
     164The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't get at it.
     165With what?  your bare hands?  against *his* bear hands??
     166The bear is confused; he only wants to be your friend.
     167For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead!
     168The bear eagerly wolfs down your food, after which he seems to calm
     168down considerably and even becomes rather friendly.
     169The bear is still chained to the wall.
     170The chain is still locked.
     171The chain is now unlocked.
     172The chain is now locked.
     173There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.
     174There is nothing here to eat.
     175Do you want the hint?
     176Do you need help getting out of the maze?
     177You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things.
     178Are you trying to explore beyond the plover room?
     179There is a way to explore that region without having to worry about
     179falling into a pit.  None of the objects available is immediately
     179useful in discovering the secret.
     180Do you need help getting out of here?
     181Don't go west.
     182Gluttony is not one of the troll's vices.  Avarice, however, is.
     183Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best start wrapping this up, unless
     183you can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recall there's a vending
     183machine in the maze.  Bring some coins with you.
     184Your lamp has run out of power.
     185There's not much point in wandering around out here, and you can't
     185explore the cave without a lamp.  So let's just call it a day.
     186There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.  As you
     186turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded pirate.
     186He is carrying a large chest.  "Shiver me timbers!" he cries, "i've
     186been spotted!  i'd best hie meself off to the maze to hide me chest!"
     186with that, he vanishes into the gloom.
     187Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best go back for those batteries.
     188Your lamp is getting dim.  I'm taking the liberty of replacing the
     188batteries.
     189Your lamp is getting dim, and you're out of spare batteries.  You'd
     189best start wrapping this up.
     190I'm afraid the magazine is written in dwarvish.
     191"This is not the maze where the pirate leaves his treasure chest."
     192Hmmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10 points to
     192read it.  Should i go ahead and read it anyway?
     193It says, "there is something strange about this place, such that one
     193of the words i've always known now has a new effect."
     194It says the same thing it did before.
     195I'm afraid i don't understand.
     196"Congratulations on bringing light into the dark-room!"
     197You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon it shatters into a
     197myriad tiny fragments.
     198You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the ground.
     199You prod the nearest dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes one look at
     199you, curses, and grabs for his axe.
     200Is this acceptable?
     201There's no point in suspending a demonstration game.

       1A large cloud of green smoke appears in front of you.  It clears away
       1to reveal a tall wizard, clothed in grey.  He fixes you with a steely
       1glare and declares, "this adventure has lasted too long."  With that
       1he makes a single pass over you with his hands, and everything around
       1you fades away into a grey nothingness.
       2Even wizards have to wait longer than that!
       3I'm terribly sorry, but colossal cave is closed.  Our hours are:
       4Only wizards are permitted within the cave right now.
       5We do allow visitors to make short explorations during our off hours.
       5Would you like to do that?
       6Colossal cave is open to regular adventurers at the following hours:
       7Very well.
       8Only a wizard may continue an adventure this soon.
       9I suggest you resume your adventure at a later time.
      10Do you wish to see the hours?
      11Do you wish to change the hours?
      12New magic word (null to leave unchanged):
      13New magic number (null to leave unchanged):
      14Do you wish to change the message of the day?
      15Okay.  You can save this version now.
      16Are you a wizard?
      17Prove it!  say the magic word!
      18That is not what i thought it was.  Do you know what i thought it was?
      19Oh dear, you really *are* a wizard!  sorry to have bothered you . . .
      20Foo, you are nothing but a charlatan!
      21New hours specified by defining "prime time".  Give only the hour
      21(e.G. 14, Not 14:00 or 2pm).  Enter a negative number after last pair.
      22New hours for colossal cave:
      23Limit lines to 70 chars.  End with null line.
      24Line too long, retype:
      25Not enough room for another line.  Ending message here.
      26Do you wish to (re)schedule the next holiday?
      27To begin how many days from today?
      28To last how many days (zero if no holiday)?
      29To be called what (up to 20 characters)?
      30Too small!  assuming minimum value (45 minutes).
      31Break out of this and save your core-image.
      32Farewell for now . . .
